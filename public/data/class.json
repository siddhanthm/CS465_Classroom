Generally speaking, as I have seen in past homeworks, the answer would omit the case where two relations have no attribute in common and only Cartesian product can be produced. We also mentioned this a little bit in slide  13: Restrict to trees “without cartesian product”: R(A,B), S(B,C), T(C,D) ((R join T) join S) has a cartesian product. Anyway, you can get full point by following the simple procedure where only relation sizes are given."
